# 🏔️ KyrosEngine

A Open-Source 3D Game Engine for mobile devices such as Android. It uses OpenGL 2 for its rendering API.

## Project Information
This project has two sub-projects,  
1. **KyrosEngine** is the main Game Engine used as Shared Library.
2. **Sandbox** is just a sample Program which is used for testing our game engine.
3. We Used **CMake** as our build tool, it is fun and easy to use. Confusing for new Users 🤪.  

**Note:** I know Game engine development is a long process, but this is something that i wanted to do.
